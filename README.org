** K-nearest neighbors in parallel 

Just what it says. Maybe compare CUDA and MPI, or OpenCV.

** Parallel in time monte carlo
I am not sure which idea to do yet. I wonder if the parallel-in-time
idea can be extended to a Monte Carlo Simulation. Two test problems
would be some sort of SDE or a chemical reaction model with spatial
dependence (Ising).

For the chemical reaction model, the course step the course grid step
could be done using the tau-leaping approach, and the fine grid could
be done using the exact Gillespie algorithm or a smaller time step
tau-leaping.

Another potential problem of interest with an obvious slow/fast
behavior would be integrating a Boussinesq system with QG as a fast
time step.
